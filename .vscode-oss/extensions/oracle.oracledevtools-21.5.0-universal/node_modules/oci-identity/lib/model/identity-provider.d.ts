* The resulting base object when you add an identity provider to your tenancy. A
* {@link Saml2IdentityProvider}
* is a specific type of `IdentityProvider` that supports the SAML 2.0 protocol. Each

* [Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,

* see [Get Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string
* values using the API.
