/**
* An `AuthToken` is an Oracle-generated token string that you can use to authenticate with third-party APIs
* that do not support Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's signature-based authentication. For example, use an `AuthToken`
* to authenticate with a Swift client with the Object Storage Service.
* <p>
The auth token is associated with the user's Console login. Auth tokens never expire. A user can have up to two
* auth tokens at a time.
* <p>
**Note:** The token is always an Oracle-generated string; you can't change it to a string of your choice.
* <p>
