* A set of DHCP options. Used by the VCN to automatically provide configuration
* information to the instances when they boot up. There are two options you can set:
* <p>
- {@link DhcpDnsOption}: Lets you specify how DNS (hostname resolution) is
* handled in the subnets in your VCN.
* <p>
- {@link DhcpSearchDomainOption}: Lets you specify
* a search domain name to use for DNS queries.
* <p>
For more information, see  [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm)
* and [DHCP Options](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingDHCP.htm).
