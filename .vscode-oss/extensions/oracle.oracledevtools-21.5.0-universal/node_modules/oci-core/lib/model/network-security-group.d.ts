/**
* A *network security group* (NSG) provides virtual firewall rules for a specific set of
* {@link Vnic} in a VCN. Compare NSGs with {@link SecurityList},
* which provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a *subnet*.
* <p>
A network security group consists of two items:
* <p>
  * The set of {@link Vnic} that all have the same security rule needs (for
*     example, a group of Compute instances all running the same application)
*   * A set of NSG {@link SecurityRule} that apply to the VNICs in the group
* <p>
After creating an NSG, you can add VNICs and security rules to it. For example, when you create
* an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs to add the instance to (see
* {@link #createVnicDetails(CreateVnicDetailsRequest) createVnicDetails}). Or you can add an existing
* instance to an NSG with {@link #updateVnic(UpdateVnicRequest) updateVnic}.
* <p>
To add security rules to an NSG, see
* {@link #addNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules(AddNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRulesRequest) addNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules}.
* <p>
To list the VNICs in an NSG, see
* {@link #listNetworkSecurityGroupVnics(ListNetworkSecurityGroupVnicsRequest) listNetworkSecurityGroupVnics}.
* <p>
To list the security rules in an NSG, see
* {@link #listNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules(ListNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRulesRequest) listNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules}.
* <p>
For more information about network security groups, see
* [Network Security Groups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).
* <p>
**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images automatically include firewall rules (for example,
* Linux iptables, Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance,
* make sure all of the following are set correctly:
* <p>
  * Any security rules in any NSGs the instance's VNIC belongs to
*   * Any {@link SecurityList} associated with the instance's subnet
*   * The instance's OS firewall rules
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
