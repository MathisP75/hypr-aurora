/**
* The platform configuration requested for the instance.
* <p>
If you provide the parameter, the instance is created with the platform configuration that you specify.
* For any values that you omit, the instance uses the default configuration values for the `shape` that you
* specify. If you don't provide the parameter, the default values for the `shape` are used.
* <p>
Each shape only supports certain configurable values. If the values that you provide are not valid for the
* specified `shape`, an error is returned.
