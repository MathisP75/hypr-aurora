/**
* A set of virtual firewall rules for your VCN. Security lists are configured at the subnet
* level, but the rules are applied to the ingress and egress traffic for the individual instances
* in the subnet. The rules can be stateful or stateless. For more information, see
* [Security Lists](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm).
* **Note:** Compare security lists to {@link NetworkSecurityGroup}s,
* which let you apply a set of security rules to a *specific set of VNICs* instead of an entire
* subnet. Oracle recommends using network security groups instead of security lists, although you
* can use either or both together.
* <p>
**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images automatically include firewall rules (for example,
* Linux iptables, Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance,
* make sure both the security lists associated with the instance's subnet and the instance's
* firewall rules are set correctly.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
