/**
* A resource to be used only with the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.
* <p>
Conceptually, a virtual LAN (VLAN) is a broadcast domain that is created
* by partitioning and isolating a network at the data link layer (a *layer 2 network*).
* VLANs work by using IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tags. Layer 2 traffic is forwarded within the
* VLAN based on MAC learning.
* <p>
In the Networking service, a VLAN is an object within a VCN. You use VLANs to
* partition the VCN at the data link layer (layer 2). A VLAN is analagous to a subnet,
* which is an object for partitioning the VCN at the IP layer (layer 3).
