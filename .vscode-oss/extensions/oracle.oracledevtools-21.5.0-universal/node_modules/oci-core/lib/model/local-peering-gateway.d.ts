/**
* A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN peer

* communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing the
* internet or routing through your on-premises network. For more information,
* see [VCN Peering](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm).
