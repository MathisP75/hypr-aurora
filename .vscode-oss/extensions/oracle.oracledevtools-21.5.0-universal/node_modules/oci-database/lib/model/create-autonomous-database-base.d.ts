 * Details to create an Oracle Autonomous Database.

 **Notes:**
 * - To specify OCPU core count, you must use either `ocpuCount` or `cpuCoreCount`. You cannot use both parameters at the same time.
 * - To specify a storage allocation, you must use  either `dataStorageSizeInGBs` or `dataStorageSizeInTBs`.
 * - See the individual parameter discriptions for more information on the OCPU and storage value parameters.

 **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.
