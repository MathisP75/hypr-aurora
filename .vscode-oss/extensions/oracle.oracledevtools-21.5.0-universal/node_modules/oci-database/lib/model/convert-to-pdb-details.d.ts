     * - Use `SYNC` if the non-container database was manually converted into a pluggable database using the dbcli command-line utility. Databases may need to be converted manually if the CONVERT action fails when converting a non-container database using the API.
     * - Use `SYNC_ROLLBACK` if the conversion of a non-container database into a pluggable database was manually rolled back using the dbcli command line utility. Conversions may need to be manually rolled back if the CONVERT action fails when converting a non-container database using the API.
